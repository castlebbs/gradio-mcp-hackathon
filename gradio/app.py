Based on the player's bio, generate a list of exactly {num_assets} specific 3D asset prompts that would compose a scene tailored to their interests, personality, and background.

Objects should be deeply personal and couldn't exist in any generic asset library. You should combine multiple elements into a single prompt if they are closely related. For instance, if the player loves both coffee and gaming, you might create a prompt for a "gaming desk with a custom coffee station."
Prefer 3d assets, which combine multiple elements instead of single objects like a piece of furniture or a decoration.
Each prompt should include: 3d isomorphic, white background. This is for 3D game asset generation.
Format your response as a simple JSON array of strings, where each string is a detailed prompt for 3D generation. Focus on objects like furniture, decorations, equipment, or environmental elements.

Follow this format:
